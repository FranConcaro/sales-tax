# Sales Tax
Problem Statement

Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.



When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. 

The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.



## Write an application that prints out the receipt details.


Finally some important HINTS: 

* Follow professional coding standards (naming conventions, files conventions, separation of concerns, using functions and naming the functions properly)
* Create test cases (jest, rspec, etc)
* Make sure you test your code
* Validate all the examples work with your code. Given examples are assumed correct
* Remember no frameworks (no rails for example) you should be able to use straight Ruby or Javascript
